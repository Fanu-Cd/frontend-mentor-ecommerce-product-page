### What I learned

What I Learned While I Implemented the ecommerce product page

- Built a responsive product page layout that adapts smoothly to all screen sizes using React and Next.js.

- Used Mantine Carousel and Portal(Full screen Overlay) to create a lightbox gallery that opens on images preview.

- Implemented thumbnail image selection to dynamically update the main product image.

- Managed cart functionality including add-to-cart, view cart, and remove items using React state.

- Applied hover effects to all interactive elements for better user experience and feedback.

- Used Mantine hooks like useDisclosure to control modals and useMediaQuery to control responsiveness

- Gained experience integrating design and interactivity using Mantine components with Tailwind styling.
